# key_exchange_visualization

This project focuses on developing a user-friendly application that demonstrates the functionality of the "Diffie-Hellman protocol." The protocol offers a secure algorithm enabling two parties to establish a shared secret key even when communicating through an insecure channel.

Our primary objective is to present this cryptographic protocol in a clear and easily comprehensible manner, emphasizing the key exchange process. The visualization of the protocol is achieved through the utilization of cutting-edge "Flutter" technology.

The application is available across multiple platforms, including:

Android
iOS
Desktop (compatible with all operating systems)
Web
