# key_exchange_visualization

This work is about the implementation of a didactic application that visualizes the “Diffie-Hellman protocol”. This protocol provides an algorithm that allows two parties to securely agree on a shared secret key over an insecure channel.
The goal of this work is to describe this cryptographic protocol in a simple way to understand the key exchange process. The protocol is visualized using “Flutter” technology.

To test the application you can visit the following link:
